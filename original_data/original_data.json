In this theory , discourse structure is composed of three separate but interrelated components : the structure of the sequence of utterances ( called the linguistic structure ) , a structure of purposes ( called the intentional structure ) , and the state of focus of attention ( called the attentional state ) . The linguistic structure consists of segments of the discourse into which the utterances naturally aggregate . The intentional structure captures the discourse-relevant purposes , expressed in each of the linguistic segments as well as relationships among them . The attentional state is an abstraction of the focus of attention of the participants as the discourse unfolds . The attentional state , being dynamic , records the objects , properties , and relations that are salient at each point of the discourse . The distinction among these components is essential to provide an adequate explanation of such discourse phenomena as cue phrases , referring expressions , and interruptions . The theory of attention , intention , and aggregation of utterances is illustrated in the paper with a number of example discourses . Various properties of discourse are described , and explanations for the behaviour of cue phrases , referring expressions , and interruptions are explored . This theory provides a framework for describing the processing of utterances in a discourse . Discourse processing requires recognizing how the utterances of the discourse aggregate into segments , recognizing the intentions expressed in the discourse and the relationships among intentions , and tracking the discourse through the operation of the mechanisms associated with attentional state . This processing description specifies in these recognition tasks the role of information from the discourse and from the participants ' knowledge of the domain .", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[31, 60, "Method"], [1133, 1196, "Method"], [1514, 1534, "Method"], [1863, 1880, "Task"]]}

We introduce the multi-view color constancy problem , and present a method to recover estimates of underlying surface re-flectance based on joint estimation of these surface properties and the illuminants present in multiple images . The method can exploit image correspondences obtained by various alignment techniques , and we show examples based on matching local region features . Our results show that multi-view constraints can significantly improve estimates of both scene illuminants and object color ( surface reflectance ) when compared to a baseline single-view method .", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[52, 76, "Task"], [110, 129, "Material"], [193, 208, "Task"], [221, 251, "Method"], [262, 281, "Material"], [357, 395, "Task"], [648, 682, "Task"], [717, 761, "Task"], [930, 950, "Method"], [1087, 1163, "Task"], [1183, 1210, "Method"]]}
